    "body": "Mirrored from: w3ctag/design-reviews#1110\n\nこんにちは TAG-さん!\n\nI'm requesting a TAG review of `windowAudio` option for `getDisplayMedia()`.\n\nThe `windowAudio` option extends the `getDisplayMedia()` API, allowing Web applications to provide a hint to the user agent regarding the preferred audio source. When `getDisplayMedia()` is called, the user agent allows the user to choose a tab, window or screen - and optionally a corresponding audio source.\n- For *tabs* the corresponding audio source is that tab’s audio.\n- For *screens* the corresponding audio source is system audio.\n\nThis new option affects the audio source associated with *windows*. In that case, the hint allows the Web application to indicate whether the UA should offer as the corresponding audio source the window’s audio, the system’s audio, or no audio at all. (The rationale for this is elaborated in the explainer, which is linked below.)\n\n - Explainer: https://github.com/drkron/explainers/blob/main/windowAudio_Explainer.md\n - Specification: https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-screen-share/#dom-displaymediastreamoptions-windowaudio \n - WPT Tests: WPT tests are not feasible because (i) this option is but a **hint** which can be spec-compliantly ignored by the user agent and (ii) the hint may affect the UA’s own UX, e.g. by affecting which of several possible audio sources is most prominently presented to the user.\n - User research: N/A\n - Security and Privacy self-review: https://github.com/drkron/documents/blob/main/sp-questionnaire-window-audio.md\n - GitHub repo: https://github.com/w3c/mediacapture-screen-share\n - Primary contacts:\n     - Johannes Kron (@drkron), Google\n     - Olga Sharanova (@o1ka), Google\n - This work is being funded by: Google\n - Primary standards group developing this feature: \n     - WebRTC WG\n - Incubation and standards groups that have discussed the design:\n    - WebRTC WG\n - Multi-stakeholder support:\n     - The feature has consensus in the WebRTC WG with positive feedback from all major browsers. It was discussed in the WebRTC [WG meeting on May 20, 2025](https://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc/wiki/May_20_2025) and later [merged](https://github.com/w3c/mediacapture-screen-share/pull/323) to the specification. \n - Major unresolved issues with or opposition to this specification: None.\n - Status/issue trackers for implementations:\n    - Chrome Status: https://chromestatus.com/feature/5072779506089984 \n\nFurther details:\n\n - [x] I have reviewed the TAG's [Web Platform Design Principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/)\n - Relevant time constraints or deadlines: None at this time.\n\nYou should also know that...\n\nWe believe this fills a crucial gap in the existing API by offering a hint for window-specific audio behavior, mirroring the existing `SystemAudioPreferenceEnum` for monitor captures.\n",
